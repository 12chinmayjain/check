      <h2>About Me</h2>
  
      <p>
        Hi! I'm <span class="highlight">Chinmay Jain</span>, a passionate <span class="highlight">System Engineer</span> with 3 years of experience in the <span class="highlight">healthcare domain</span>, working with a leading client, Humana. I specialize in designing and building scalable <span class="highlight">RESTful APIs</span> using <span class="highlight">.NET Core</span> and creating intuitive web applications with <span class="highlight">Angular</span>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I started my career focused on backend development, building APIs from the ground up and optimizing their performance. This included using stored procedures, creating indexes, and implementing caching to reduce redundant database calls. As I grew, I transitioned into a full-stack role — now I handle everything from backend development to frontend integration and testing.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        One key turning point was the beginning of my journey with <span class="highlight">.NET Core and C#</span>. As a fresh professional, I initially struggled with the tech stack and tight deadlines. But through persistence and continuous learning, I adapted, delivered, and grew tremendously — even earning a recognition award from my team.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        My programming roots go back to college, where I started with <span class="highlight">C++</span> and then shifted to <span class="highlight">Python</span> for its simplicity and versatility. I explored everything from DSA to building projects like <em>Cars</em> (a car filtering system based on user needs) and <em>Weblocks</em> (a site builder using given templates).
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Outside work, I love <span class="highlight">playing badminton</span>, <span class="highlight">reading books</span>, and <span class="highlight">listening to music</span>. These hobbies help me recharge and bring a fresh perspective to my work.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Currently, I’m strengthening my core in <span class="highlight">web development</span> and revisiting <span class="highlight">data structures & algorithms</span> to stay sharp. I find genuine satisfaction in working with new technologies and delivering projects that meet client expectations with precision.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I'm always open to new opportunities to collaborate, learn, and build something impactful. If you're looking for a reliable and versatile developer who loves solving problems — let's connect.
